          <td>For years I've been conflicted about clothing tags/labels as it pertains to this brand. Initially, when I first started in 2016, I was unconcerned with interior, experiential-based branding that was invisible to the clothing garment when in use. This meant I didn't have tags, labels, stickers—all the tangibles that are commonplace in clothing companies aside from the clothing item itself. I was fairly myopic, practical, frugal, and wanted only to make a cool graphic. This version of me has remained steadfast in the brand's identity even to this day. However, as I grew older and went through a rigurous arts training in the form of "school" ("university" in the UK), I grew to become respectably literate in "graphic arts" and passably to reasonably literate in "fine arts". These two, although both operating in the same "art" world, were often at odds; the former praised commerce, while the latter denounced commerce. I thought both had valid points. In graphic design, there exists an explicit brand and/or system that is worked to be made overt so that the brand can be easily recognized which will generate them more money. This logic argues for a customized, branded clothing tag since that is what will improve the brand image (and generate more money). From a business standpoint, this makes sense.
          <br><br>
          On the other hand, the business as a functioning ("fine") art project hopes to exist on a different plane—one that a custom tag might interfere with. In jeopardy are my themes relating to:
            <ol>
              <li><b>Readymades</b>, which is defined by <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/r/readymade#:~:text=The%20term%20readymade%20was%20first,artists%20made%20in%20this%20way"><i><u>Tate</u></i></a> as a term "first used by French artist Marcel Duchamp to describe the works of art he made from manufactured objects". I enjoy this term because it often justifies (in a poetic way) the use of cheap, mundane, and accessible things in high art. This manifests for me in this project as a premade, "blank" T-shirt.</li>
              <li><b>A focused labor</b>, where all available energy is put towards the graphics and everything else is treated with an irreverance that could possibly produce interesting aesthetic results as a byproduct. This often works well and is best seen in graphic design, where an indifference toward font size or hierarchy creates cool compositions within its system.</li>
              <li><b>The family business</b> (my parents T-shirt company), where GILDAN is used in an uncharged, reductive manner for purely economical reasons, producing an honest, earnest, and authentic thing.</li>
            </ol>
          The moment I rip the GILDAN tag out of the shirts is the moment these ideas become unfounded (if they were at all in the first place). 
          <br><br>But, to not rip it out is to say I dislike money, which is untrue. Mainly, from a money perspective, I am concerned with brand visibility in non-my-webstore-or-this-website environments—i.e. stockists. In a physical store, it's crucial (to a fatal extent) that a browser/potential customer knows where the product comes from; exposure, visibility and follows are all at risk when you don't assert your brand name on the garment. Additionally, a custom neck tag has a certain professionalism to it that is probably respected not only by the consumer, but by the store owners/buyers alike. I have no expectation that my loose, aforementioned reasoning for keeping the GILDAN tags in is thought about in any form. It most likely comes off as lazy, which is not a desirable trait for a brand owner. I also wonder if they are ever embarrassed of the tags or if they rip it out themselves.
          <br><br>
          That brings me to these new, heat transfer tags I am experimenting with. As of now, they are only present in garments that are in physical stores. They are square, 1.5" DTF tags that cost $0.10 each. They require 25 total seconds (15 seconds, cool off, peel, 10 more seconds) of heat pressing and seem to be fairly durable. I will most likely start to use them on direct-to-consumer products for the next collection. As of now, the GILDAN (and Hanes®) tags remain in. Also, GILDAN just recently changed to a new tag, marking another arbitrary era for the titans of the industry. They march forward no matter how much they are shit on by the insufferable, pretentious "streetwear" industry.

            <td>It has long been sought after: the ability to efficiently print light graphics on dark garments using direct-to-garment printing as the process requires a few extra, fairly laborious steps that are often more trouble than its worth. In my efforts to create a thematically interesting and financially successful clothing brand, I pretty consistently feel the need to expand into the dark garment territory even though my tools may not be built for it. This cumpulsion stems from a few insecurities/desires: 
                <ol>
                    <li>A majority of people prefer dark garments to light garments (specifically black and/or navy blue). Not many people wear white or grey T-shirts or hoodies.</li>
                    <li>I feel the need to diversify the color palette of the blanks I am using for aesthetic-driven branding reasons.</li>
                    <li>I want to explore different color interactions, generally.</li>
                </ol>
            In the new collection, I have two hoodies that employ light-on-dark printing. Having been through the traditional process of pretreating + underbasing for previous collections and finding it to be unfruitful, I decided to explore new, alternative ways of printing light graphics on dark garments. Ultimately, I did decide to stick with the aforementioned process of pretreating + underbasing, but I figured it would be helpful to others if I shared my failed experiments seeing as there is a lack of information about different techniques online.

Additionally, I had a few photo based graphics for this collection which were contained within a rectangle—because of the lack of emulsion-based resources (power-washer, transparency printer, exposure unit, etc.), I figured you would only be able to theoretically print graphics contained within a rectangle. Also, because of possible registration issues, you would need to consider leaving some margin for trapping purposes. The main concern presented by others online was the combination of plastisol and T-Jet inks and if the two would interact well. After consulting the team (my dad) and watching a fairly convincing youtube video, I decided it would be worth a shot and bought a 20x24" <i>Blick</i> screen, a medium sized container of white <i>Speedball® Fabric Ink</i>, and a 8" wooden handled <i>Blick</i> Squeegee. I then screenprinted a white rectangle on a scrap, navy blue hoodie.</div></td>

After that last heatpress, the print actually looked quite good; it seemed to be sitting atop the plastisol screenprint ink nicely and looked more vibrant than using the white ink underbase from the T-Jet. Alas, after doing a quick wash test, the DTG ink washed off, leaving the ever-ghostly void of the white screenprinted rectangle.</div></td>

One of the problems with white DTG ink, I've been told, is its consistency, which is partly an adhesive glue-like substance, which is damaging to the print head, which often gets clogged by the ink. It is a sacrifice one must make, however. On the left is the print with 3 underbase passes (coats of white ink) and on the right is the print with 2 underbase passes. After some tweaking with the "Ink" button on the T-Jet, the 3 underbase option proved to be satisfactory and I proceeded with that method for the final hoodies.</div></td>
