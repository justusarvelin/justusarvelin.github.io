        <p>Helsingfors Modern is a sans-serif typeface with an expressionistic tone that goes beyond a simple, stripped-down design. It began as a continuation of a type project that I, Justus Arvelin, developed for my Bachelor’s thesis in 2023. My original work was inspired by two historic typefaces—Washington and Navarra—originally created by the German type foundry Schelter & Giesecke.</p>
      <p class="paragraphscnd">Since then, I revisited the project, giving it a complete facelift and making substantial updates. Despite these changes, I aimed to retain the unique balance of playfulness and grotesque qualities that defined Washington and Navarra. This time, I introduced subtle variations in glyph widths, drawing inspiration from the German typeface Kabel. I named the typeface Helsingfors Modern, inspired by one of the original variations I found called *Washington Modernische.</p>
      <p class="paragraphscnd">My ultimate goal was to create a typeface that functions well as body copy while carrying a unique, expressive character. </p>

      <p>In my thesis I studied typography, type design and why fonts are designed and I also designed a typeface. The aim is not to find the perfect answer, but rather to present different solutions to justify the design of a new font, and questions to help make decisions. In addition to the importance of justifying design work, the thesis focuses on the vocabulary of typography and its dialect, as well as sans-serif typefaces. The output is a typeface based on an old, previously undigitised typeface.</p>
      <p class="paragraphscnd">The thesis explores different interpretations of typographic vocabulary, defines the meaning of the word font, discusses different ways of designing typefaces and how different typographers view typefaces today. However, the thesis does not discuss the practical needs for which fonts are still designed, such as communication, language preservation and accessibility, but focuses on answering the question from the designer's point of view. A look at the classification of typefaces and the challenges it poses shows that there is a need for a new classification system, while a look at the changing face of typography and its current state shows that design work today is very much screen-to-screen rather than on paper. The thesis also opens up the history of sans-serif typefaces.</p>
      <p class="paragraphscnd">The production is a typeface based on the old German typefaces Navarre, Washington and Columbus designed by Schelter & Giesecke. None of these three has ever been digitised. The production balances between its own interpretation and the preservation of the old, while focusing on creating something new rather than simply copying the old. The aim of the production is to find a way of designing that justifies the type design work, both for the designer himself and for the public. The end result is very much in line with the objectives of designing a typeface in a way that is informed and open. The justification for the work comes largely from the need to learn and create, but also from the need to preserve old typefaces.</p>
      <p class="paragraphscnd" id="last_td">The thesis explores typography, its transformation and in particular highlights the importance of transparency in design. The conclusion is that you can design typefaces for the joy of designing, but it is essential to be open about your design process, its background and intentions. This is an activity that promotes both typography and graphic design in general and is therefore very important. A more important measure of significance than the output of the work is the designer's ability to justify and verbalise the design process and its outcome.</p>
